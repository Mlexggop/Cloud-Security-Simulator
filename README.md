## Overview  
CloudSentinel provides **hands-on AWS security simulations** in a controlled environment. Users encounter common misconfigurations, practice remediation, and receive feedback scores, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application.  

Key technologies include:  
- **React.js + TypeScript** for interactive UI  
- **Node.js** backend for simulation logic  
- **AWS (IAM, VPC, S3, Lambda)** for realistic cloud scenarios  
- **Python** for backend simulation scripts and scoring

## Why Use CloudSentinel  
Traditional training often lacks practical AWS experience. CloudSentinel:  

1. **Builds Hands-On Skills** → Learn AWS security in realistic scenarios.  
2. **Reduces Risk** → Safe sandboxed environment for practice.  
3. **Provides Feedback** → Scoring and progress tracking enhance learning.  
4. **Boosts Confidence** → Prepares engineers for real-world cloud security challenges.  

---

## Target Users  
- **Security Engineers** → Practice threat detection and remediation.  
- **Cloud Developers** → Understand and fix common misconfigurations.  
- **Students & Learners** → Gain hands-on experience in cloud security.  
- **Training Organizations** → Deploy interactive security learning modules.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Scenario Generation** → Backend scripts create AWS misconfigurations in a sandbox.  
2. **User Interaction** → Frontend guides users through identifying and fixing issues.  
3. **Scoring & Feedback** → Real-time evaluation of user actions and remediation steps.  
4. **Dashboard Metrics** → Track progress, completion time, and skill improvement.  
5. **Sandbox Reset** → Restore environment to repeat scenarios safely.  

---

## Use Cases  
- **Corporate Security Training** → Upskill cloud engineers and DevOps teams.  
- **Educational Platforms** → Teach AWS security best practices interactively.  
- **Certifications Prep** → Hands-on practice for AWS Security exams.  
- **Skill Assessment** → Evaluate employee readiness in simulated environments.  

---

## Future Plans  
1. **Additional Cloud Providers** → Include GCP and Azure security simulations.  
2. **Advanced Scenario Builder** → Users can design custom security challenges.  
3. **AI-Based Feedback** → Suggest optimized remediation steps automatically.  
4. **Gamified Learning** → Leaderboards, badges, and skill progression tracking.
